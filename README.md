# üè° Domu

A small web app applications that I'm building while learning React!

There are two main sections:
- Bacheca: where ideal normal users (neighbours) can insert, delete, mark as read/to read;
- Comunicazioni: here only the administrator will upload comunications that the neighbours are going to read.

Actually all the posts and communications are not in a database but are a predefined objects.

## Relevant technologies used

- Tailwind CSS 3 for styling
- React Redux Toolkit for managing the posts state
- React Router DOM for routing
