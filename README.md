# üè° Domu

## Domu what?

This is a small web app that I'm building while learning React!

There are two main sections:
- Bacheca: where ideal normal users (neighbours) can insert, delete, mark as read/to read;
- Comunicazioni: here only the administrator will upload comunications that the neighbours are going to read.

Actually all the posts and communications are not in a database but are a predefined objects.

## How to run project

You can clone the repository and then run the following command (the web app was created using Vite)

```npm run dev```

## Relevant technologies used

- Tailwind CSS 3 for styling
- React Redux Toolkit for managing the posts state
- React Router DOM for routing
